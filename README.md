# TheBumApp
A jokey Discord bot who speaks the word of our Lord (aka a document produced by an absurd machine learning algorithm).

Run bot.py to run the bot. I have no idea what will happen if multiple people try to run it concurrently.

DM the bot 'logout' to get it to logout. Or kill the shell while it's running.

Get the .env file from John. This contains the secrets. Maybe we should figure out how to upload the secrets securely.

pip install discord python-dotenv youtube_dl gtts PyNaCl

Also put ffmpeg.exe in the directory or on the PATH.
